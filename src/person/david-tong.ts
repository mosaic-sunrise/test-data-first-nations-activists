  bio: "David Tong is a climate activist and traditional leader from Kiribati who advocates for the rights of climate refugees and the preservation of Pacific Island cultures threatened by sea level rise. As his nation faces the possibility of becoming uninhabitable due to climate change, Tong works to ensure that I-Kiribati people maintain their cultural identity and rights even if forced to relocate. His advocacy combines traditional navigation knowledge with modern climate science to document environmental changes. Tong's work highlights how climate change represents cultural genocide for Pacific Island peoples.",
