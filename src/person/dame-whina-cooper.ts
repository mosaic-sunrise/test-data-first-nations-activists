  bio: "Dame Whina Cooper transformed from an 18-year-old challenging mudflat leases to the revered mother of a nation leading a 1,100-kilometer march at age 79. This Te Rarawa leader organized the 1975 Māori Land March from Cape Reinga to Parliament, walking the length of New Zealand with the simple demand: \"Not one more acre of Māori land.\" Her march grew from 50 to 5,000 supporters and delivered a petition signed by 60,000 people, forcing land rights back into national consciousness. Cooper proved that moral leadership could move mountains, earning the title Te Whaea o te Motu—Mother of the Nation.",
