  bio: "John Trudell channeled his activism through poetry, music, and spoken word, becoming one of the most compelling voices in the American Indian Movement. A Santee Dakota activist, he served as AIM's national chairman for many years and was a constant presence at protests and occupations throughout the 1970s. After the suspicious deaths of his wife, three children, and mother-in-law in a house fire in 1979, Trudell turned increasingly to artistic expression as a form of resistance. His poetry and music explored themes of Indigenous identity, spirituality, and the ongoing struggle against colonization, creating works that resonated far beyond Native communities.",
