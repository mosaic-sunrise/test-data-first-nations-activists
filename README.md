# First Nations Activists Dataset

Real biographies of First Nations, Indigenous, Aboriginal, and tribal activists from around the world — packaged as test data for use in demos, fixtures, and test suites.

**Please read the [Cultural Notice](#-important-cultural-notice) before using this dataset.**

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install @mosaic-code/first-nations-activists-data @mosaic-code/test-data-factory
```

```typescript
import DataFactory from '@mosaic-code/test-data-factory';
import firstNationsActivistsData from '@mosaic-code/first-nations-activists-data';

// The acknowledgment should come from a deliberate user opt-in, not be
// hardcoded. In CI/tests an env var works; in a UI, surface a
// confirmation prompt and pass its result. Without this set to true, the
// factory loads no data — your test suite still runs, just without this
// dataset included.
const factory = new DataFactory(firstNationsActivistsData, {
  acknowledgeDeceasedFirstNations: process.env.ACKNOWLEDGE_FIRST_NATIONS === 'true',
});

// Three random people for your test
const users = factory.getPeople(3);

// A specific person by id
const winona = factory.getPerson('winona-laduke');

// People in a particular group
const aim = factory.getPeopleInGroup('american-indian-movement');
```

For deterministic output across test runs, call `factory.setSeed(<number>)` first.

## ⚠️ Important Cultural Notice

**This dataset contains names, images, and biographical information of deceased Indigenous persons.**

In keeping with Indigenous cultural protocols and values, we acknowledge that:

- Many Indigenous communities have specific cultural practices regarding the sharing of information about deceased persons
- Some communities may prefer that names, images, or stories of deceased ancestors not be shared publicly
- Each Indigenous culture has unique protocols around honoring and remembering those who have passed on

**If you are using this dataset and have concerns about cultural appropriateness or specific protocols that should be observed, please contact us immediately.**

Every effort has been made to present these individuals with dignity and respect, focusing on their public contributions to Indigenous rights and environmental justice. However, technical datasets cannot fully capture the cultural significance and protocols surrounding Indigenous knowledge keepers and activists.
