  bio: "Buffy Sainte-Marie used her music as a vehicle for social change and Indigenous rights advocacy throughout her decades-long career. A Cree singer-songwriter and educator, she wrote powerful protest songs that addressed war, social injustice, and the struggles facing Indigenous peoples. Her 1964 song \"Universal Soldier\" became an anti-war anthem, while tracks like \"Now That the Buffalo's Gone\" brought attention to the ongoing displacement and oppression of Native Americans. Beyond music, Sainte-Marie pioneered the use of digital technology in Indigenous education and spent years working to improve educational opportunities for Native children.",
