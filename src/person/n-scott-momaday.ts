  bio: "N. Scott Momaday made literary history in 1969 when he became the first Native American to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novel \"House Made of Dawn.\" A Kiowa author, poet, and professor, Momaday grew up between two worlds - his father's Kiowa heritage and his mother's European-American background - experiences that deeply influenced his writing. His work explores themes of identity, place, and the relationship between traditional and modern ways of life. Beyond his literary achievements, Momaday has been a influential educator, helping establish Native American studies programs and mentoring countless Indigenous writers and scholars.",
